    * "" shouldEqual ""

  behavior of "currency equals"

  it should "match 2 Â£ values as the same when their values are equal" in {
    val c1: Currency = "1 GBP"
    val c2: Currency = "1 GBP"
    c1 should equal(c2)
    c1 should ===(c2)
    c1 shouldEqual c2
    c1 shouldBe c2
    c1 should be(c2)
  }
}
